## description

Parses chat logs and relays it to an IRC or SMS server.

An IRC bot sits in the channel and relays back to a network of game clients through a mod.

This two way communication would let you participate in chat from outside the game from protocols and devices like IRC, IM, email, SMS, even your cell phone.
